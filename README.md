## Localhost using Express

A quick app to show how to deploy a localhost using Express.js and Node.js

Install the express dependency from npm with 'npm install express'. Express will create node_modules and package-lock.json files.

Create an HTML file to display on the localhost in the browser.

Create an app.js file and setup your request/response to send and receive your file path and choose your localhost port with `.listen` (using 3000 in the example). A node http server is returned with `.listen` using a function as a callback.
